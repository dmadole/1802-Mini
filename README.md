# 1802-Mini
This is a modular, expandable, 1802-based computer envisioned for uses from an SBC to eventually a multi-user timesharing system. Inspired by tebl/1802-Cosmac-ELF.

I have split this project into separate repositories, and for lack of a better understanding of git, I am just linking to them in this README.md file for now.
